special instructions -
  The date should be entered in the form of "yyyy-mm-dd". The program also accepts the form of "yyyy-m-d" (such as "2020-1-1 instead of 2020-01-01" also works.)
  The date is expected to be complited. To be more specific, it should includ all three parts of "year" "month" and "day." If only a year or month is included and other parts is missing there will be an ArrayOutOfBoundsException. 
  The farm is expected to be in form of "Farm #" or "farm #" or "FARM #". The letter case matters, but if there is space between the number and the word farm does not.
  The weight should be in the same range of doubles in java.
