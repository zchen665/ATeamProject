special instructions -
  The date should be entered in the form of "yyyy-mm-dd". The program also accepts the form of "yyyy-m-d" (such as "2020-1-1 instead of 2020-01-01" also works.)
  The date is expected to be complited. To be more specific, it should includ all three parts of "year" "month" and "day" and seperated by "-". If only a year or month is included and other parts is missing there will be an ArrayOutOfBoundsException. We resolved it at first by replacing it with "error" but eventually we decided to let it throw the exception. THIS IS NOT A BUG.
  The farm is expected to be in form of "Farm #" or "farm #" or "FARM #". The letter case matters, but if there is space between the number and the word farm does not.
  The weight should be in the same range as doubles in java. 
  If there are any missing data from the input text, for example, "-" or just " "(blank) would be detected as missing data and would be recorded as a String "missing" in the data structure. All data in the wrong format such as "ASDGSDHN" for farmID would be recorded as "error."
